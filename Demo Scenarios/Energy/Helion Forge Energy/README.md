## The Challenge

Helion Forge manages hundreds of reactor components from global suppliers, each requiring precision certification and real-time status tracking during assembly. When a plasma containment coil fails quality checks or a cryogenic pump shipment delays, the entire $400M reactor build timeline is at risk.

## What We're Building

A Reactor Component Lifecycle Management system to track parts, supplier certifications, assembly milestones, and automated alerts when critical path items are delayed.

## Custom Objects

| Object | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `Reactor_Build__c` | Reactor projects — budget, phase, target plasma date, site |
| `Component__c` | Individual parts — type, status, criticality, delivery tracking |
| `Supplier_Certification__c` | Vendor certs — ISO/nuclear/cryo grades, expiration monitoring |
| `Assembly_Milestone__c` | Build phases — foundation through first plasma ignition |

## LWC Wow Moment

A real-time reactor assembly dashboard showing a 3D-style visual of the tokamak with color-coded component status (green=installed, yellow=in-transit, red=delayed), plus a live progress ring showing percentage completion toward first plasma ignition.

## Prerequisites

- A Salesforce dev org, SDO (Simple Demo Org), or sandbox
- Salesforce CLI (`sf`) installed and authenticated
- Cursor IDE

---

## Step 00 — Project Scaffold (run in terminal before opening Cursor)

**What this step does:** Creates a new SFDX project folder and sets your target org so Cursor and the Salesforce CLI know where to deploy. Run these commands in your terminal (not in Cursor yet).

Run these commands in your terminal to create the SFDX project and set your target org:

```bash
sf project generate --name helion-forge
cd helion-forge
sf org list
sf config set target-org <your-org-alias>
```

Then open the `helion-forge` folder in Cursor and proceed with Step 01.

---

## Step 01 — Custom Objects

**What this prompt does:** Creates four custom objects—**Reactor_Build__c**, **Component__c**, **Supplier_Certification__c**, and **Assembly_Milestone__c**—with fields for reactor build info; component type, status, supplier, critical path; certification status and expiry; and milestone dates. Includes the relationships specified in the prompt.

Open Cursor Agent and paste:

```
Create four custom Salesforce objects for Helion Forge Energy's fusion reactor tracking system:

1. Reactor_Build__c with fields: Build_Number__c (text, external ID), Target_First_Plasma_Date__c (date), Total_Budget__c (currency), Current_Phase__c (picklist: Design, Procurement, Assembly, Testing, Commissioning), Installation_Site__c (text), Project_Manager__c (lookup to User)

2. Component__c with fields: Component_ID__c (text, external ID), Component_Name__c (text), Component_Type__c (picklist: Plasma Containment Coil, Cryogenic Pump, Vacuum Chamber, Neutral Beam Injector, Divertor Plate, Magnetic Field Coil, Diagnostic Sensor), Reactor_Build__c (master-detail to Reactor_Build__c), Status__c (picklist: Ordered, In Transit, Quality Check, Passed, Failed, Installed), Estimated_Delivery_Date__c (date), Actual_Delivery_Date__c (date), Criticality_Level__c (picklist: Critical Path, High, Medium, Low), Unit_Cost__c (currency)

3. Supplier_Certification__c with fields: Certification_Number__c (text, external ID), Supplier_Name__c (text), Component__c (lookup to Component__c), Certification_Type__c (picklist: ISO 9001, Nuclear Grade, Cryogenic Systems, High Vacuum, Plasma Physics), Certification_Date__c (date), Expiration_Date__c (date), Certification_Status__c (formula: if expiration date is within 30 days return 'Expiring Soon', if expired return 'Expired', else 'Valid'), Inspector_Name__c (text)

4. Assembly_Milestone__c with fields: Milestone_Name__c (text), Reactor_Build__c (master-detail to Reactor_Build__c), Planned_Completion_Date__c (date), Actual_Completion_Date__c (date), Status__c (picklist: Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Delayed, Blocked), Required_Components__c (long text area - list component IDs), Lead_Engineer__c (lookup to User), Milestone_Type__c (picklist: Foundation, Vacuum Chamber Install, Magnet Integration, First Cooldown, First Plasma Test)

Create all objects with appropriate page layouts, set up the master-detail and lookup relationships, and include help text describing each field's purpose in the reactor build process.
```

## Step 02 — Sample Data

**What this prompt does:** Generates sample data: **2 reactor builds**, **20 components** (statuses: Installed, In Transit, Ordered, Delayed), **6 supplier certifications** (some expiring), and **5 assembly milestones** so the reactor dashboard and flows have data.

```
Create realistic sample data for Helion Forge Energy's reactor tracking system:

1. Create 2 Reactor_Build__c records:
   - Build_Number__c: 'HFE-TR-001', Target_First_Plasma_Date__c: 8 months from today, Total_Budget__c: 385000000, Current_Phase__c: 'Assembly', Installation_Site__c: 'Richland, Washington Facility', Project_Manager__c: assign to current user
   - Build_Number__c: 'HFE-TR-002', Target_First_Plasma_Date__c: 14 months from today, Total_Budget__c: 420000000, Current_Phase__c: 'Procurement', Installation_Site__c: 'Oak Ridge, Tennessee Facility', Project_Manager__c: assign to current user

2. Create 12 Component__c records for HFE-TR-001 with realistic component names:
   - 4 Plasma Containment Coils (Status: 2 Installed, 1 Quality Check, 1 In Transit)
   - 2 Cryogenic Pumps (Status: 1 Passed, 1 Ordered)
   - 2 Vacuum Chambers (Status: both Installed)
   - 2 Neutral Beam Injectors (Status: 1 In Transit, 1 Quality Check)
   - 1 Divertor Plate (Status: Failed - needs attention)
   - 1 Magnetic Field Coil Array (Status: Installed)
   Mix Criticality_Levels with 4 Critical Path items, use realistic costs between $500K-$15M per component

3. Create 8 Component__c records for HFE-TR-002 with Status mostly 'Ordered' or 'In Transit'

4. Create 6 Supplier_Certification__c records linking to various components:
   - Mix of certification types (Nuclear Grade, Cryogenic Systems, High Vacuum)
   - Include 1 certification expiring within 30 days and 1 expired to demonstrate alerts
   - Use supplier names like 'Oxford Cryogenics Ltd', 'Tokyo Vacuum Technologies', 'CERN Advanced Materials'

5. Create 5 Assembly_Milestone__c records for HFE-TR-001:
   - 'Foundation & Support Structure' (Completed, actual date 3 months ago)
   - 'Primary Vacuum Chamber Installation' (Completed, actual date 1 month ago)
   - 'Magnetic Confinement System Integration' (In Progress, planned date 2 weeks from now)
   - 'Cryogenic Cooling System Activation' (Not Started, planned date 3 months from now)
   - 'First Plasma Ignition Test' (Not Started, planned date 8 months from now)

Use realistic names for Lead_Engineers and make the data tell a story of a complex reactor build with some challenges.
```

## Step 03 — Permission Sets

**What this prompt does:** Creates the **Helion_Forge_Admin** permission set with full access (CRUD, View All, Modify All) on Reactor_Build__c, Component__c, Supplier_Certification__c, and Assembly_Milestone__c and their fields.

```
Create a permission set called 'Helion_Forge_Admin' that grants full access to Helion Forge Energy's custom objects and fields. The permission set should include:

1. Object permissions for Reactor_Build__c, Component__c, Supplier_Certification__c, and Assembly_Milestone__c with Read, Create, Edit, Delete, View All, and Modify All enabled

2. Field-level security set to visible and editable for all custom fields on all four objects

3. Tab visibility set to Available for any custom tabs created for these objects

4. System permissions: View Setup and Configuration, API Enabled, Modify All Data (for admin testing)

5. Set the permission set label to 'Helion Forge Energy - Full Admin Access' with description 'Complete access to reactor build tracking system for project managers and system administrators'

Generate the permission set metadata XML file and deploy it to the org.
```

---

## Step 04 — Flows & Automations

**What this prompt does:** Builds **Component_Delay_Alert** (record-triggered on Component__c—when status indicates delay, notifies and updates critical path) and **Certification_Expiration_Check** (scheduled—flags expiring Supplier_Certification__c records).

```
Create a Salesforce Flow called 'Component_Delay_Alert' that automates critical path monitoring for Helion Forge Energy:

Trigger: Record-triggered flow on Component__c when a record is created or updated

Entry Criteria: 
- Status__c changes to 'Failed' OR
- Status__c equals 'In Transit' AND Estimated_Delivery_Date__c is less than TODAY() (meaning it's overdue) AND
- Criticality_Level__c equals 'Critical Path'

Flow Actions:
1. Get the related Reactor_Build__c record to retrieve Project_Manager__c and Build_Number__c
2. Create a Task assigned to the Project_Manager__c with:
   - Subject: 'URGENT: Critical Component Delay - {Component_Name__c}'
   - Description: 'Component {Component_ID__c} for Reactor Build {Build_Number__c} is delayed or failed. Current Status: {Status__c}. This is a CRITICAL PATH item. Estimated delivery was {Estimated_Delivery_Date__c}. Immediate action required.'
   - Priority: High
   - Status: Not Started
   - Related To: the Reactor_Build__c record
3. Send email alert to Project_Manager__c with subject 'Critical Reactor Component Alert' and body including component details
4. Update the Reactor_Build__c record's Current_Phase__c to 'Delayed' if any critical path component is delayed

Also create a scheduled flow called 'Certification_Expiration_Check' that runs daily:
- Query all Supplier_Certification__c records where Expiration_Date__c is within the next 30 days and Certification_Status__c equals 'Expiring Soon'
- For each record, create a task for the Project Manager of the related Reactor Build
- Email summary of all expiring certifications to a distribution list

Build these flows using Flow Builder best practices with clear descriptions and error handling.
```

## Step 05 — Deploy to Org

**What this prompt does:** Runs deploy, assigns **Helion_Forge_Admin**, imports sample data, activates flows (if a script is used), and opens the org so you can verify the reactor list and component data.

```
Deploy all Helion Forge Energy metadata to your Salesforce dev org or SDO using Salesforce DX. Execute the following sequence:

1. First, verify the org is active and authenticated: sf org list or sfdx force:org:display --targetusername [your-org-alias]
2. Run pre-flight validation if needed: sf project deploy validate --target-org [your-org-alias]
3. Deploy all metadata: sf project deploy start --target-org [your-org-alias] (or sfdx force:source:push)
4. Assign the Helion_Forge_Admin permission set: sf org assign permset --name Helion_Forge_Admin
5. Import the sample data: sf data import tree --plan data/sample-data-plan.json
6. Activate the flows (if using a script): run the activate-flows script or activate manually in Setup
7. Open the org to verify: sf org open
8. Run a quick validation query to confirm data loaded if desired

Create any necessary data plan JSON files and Apex scripts referenced in the scenario. Handle any deployment errors gracefully and provide clear error messages if metadata conflicts occur.
```

## Step 06 — Lightning Web Component

**What this prompt does:** Builds the **reactorAssemblyDashboard** LWC: completion ring (SVG/Chart.js), tokamak-style component diagram (green/yellow/red/gray by status), metric cards (Critical Path, Budget, Certifications Expiring), and activity feed of component/milestone changes (SLDS, dark theme, electric blue/orange).

```
Build a Lightning Web Component called 'reactorAssemblyDashboard' that creates an impressive visual display of Helion Forge Energy's reactor build status:

Component Structure:
1. Top section: Large circular progress ring (using SVG or Chart.js) showing overall reactor completion percentage calculated from installed components vs total components
   - Display percentage in center with label 'Days to First Plasma: X'
   - Color gradient from orange (0%) to electric blue (100%)

2. Middle section: 3D-style tokamak reactor visualization (can be simplified SVG cross-section) with component positions marked
   - Each component type has a position on the reactor diagram
   - Color-code each component position: green circle = Installed, yellow = In Transit, red = Failed/Delayed, gray = Ordered
   - Make components clickable to show detail card

3. Bottom section: Three metric cards displaying:
   - 'Critical Path Items': count with status breakdown
   - 'Budget Status': total spent vs budget with progress bar
   - 'Certifications Expiring': count of certifications expiring within 30 days

4. Right panel: Live activity feed showing recent component status changes and milestone completions

Data Queries:
- Query Reactor_Build__c records with related Component__c, Assembly_Milestone__c, and Supplier_Certification__c child records
- Use @wire to reactively load data
- Calculate completion percentage: (components with Status='Installed' / total components) * 100
- Filter and display only Critical Path components in the alert section

Styling:
- Use Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) for base styling
- Custom CSS for the reactor diagram and progress ring
- Dark theme with electric blue accents (#00D4FF) and orange alerts (#FF6B35)
- Smooth animations when components change status
- Responsive layout that works on desktop and tablet

Make the component visually striking and immediately convey the status of this complex $400M reactor build. Include error handling for when no data is available and a loading spinner during data fetch.
```

## Step 07 — Push to GitHub (Optional)

This step is optional. Use it only if you want to version-control your project or share it on GitHub. You can skip it and still have a complete, deployed solution after Step 06.

**What this prompt does:** Initializes Git, adds .gitignore, creates README (Helion Forge - Reactor Lifecycle Management, dev org/SDO setup, object model, LWC overview), and pushes to a repo such as helion-forge-reactor-management.

```
Initialize a Git repository for the Helion Forge Energy Salesforce project and push to GitHub:

1. Initialize git in the project root directory: git init
2. Create a comprehensive .gitignore file for Salesforce DX projects that excludes: .sfdx/, .sf/, .vscode/, node_modules/, .DS_Store, *.log, .localdevserver/, .org-metadata/, config/, coverage/, .eslintcache
3. Create a detailed README.md file with: project title 'Helion Forge Energy - Reactor Component Lifecycle Management', description, installation instructions for setting up a dev org or SDO, object model documentation, component overview (reactorAssemblyDashboard LWC), demo data instructions, technology stack, and license
4. Stage all files: git add .
5. Create initial commit with message as specified in the scenario
6. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g. helion-forge-reactor-management) with gh repo create or manually
7. Add remote and push: git remote add origin [url], git branch -M main, git push -u origin main
8. Add LICENSE file (MIT) and repository topics as desired

Provide clear terminal commands and explain each step for developers unfamiliar with Git or GitHub CLI.
```
