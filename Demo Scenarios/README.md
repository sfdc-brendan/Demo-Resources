# Demo Scenarios

A collection of guided demo scenarios for Solutions Engineers. Each scenario presents a fictional company, an industry-specific business challenge, and step-by-step Cursor Agent prompts that build a complete Salesforce solution from scratch — custom objects, sample data, automations, LWCs, and deployment.

Part of **[Demo Resources](https://github.com/sfdc-brendan/Demo-Resources)** — everything in one repo.

## Cursor Enablement (start here)

**New to Cursor or AI-assisted Salesforce development?**

👉 **[Cursor Enablement README](./Cursor%20Enablement/README.md)** — Step-by-step guide for beginners: install Cursor, set up Salesforce CLI, pick a scenario, run Step 00, then Steps 01–07 in Cursor Agent (Step 07 push to GitHub is **optional**), and deploy to your org.

---

## How to Use

1. **Browse the scenarios** in the table below and pick one that fits your demo audience.
2. **Run Step 00** in your terminal to scaffold a new SFDX project and connect your target org.
3. **Open the new project folder in Cursor.**
4. **Copy/paste each prompt** (Steps 01 through 07) into Cursor Agent, one at a time, in order. **Step 07 (push to GitHub) is optional.**
5. Each step builds on the previous — let Cursor finish, verify the output, then move to the next step.
