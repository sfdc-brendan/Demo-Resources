## The Challenge

Boutique wineries struggle to track individual vineyard block performance, soil conditions, and optimal harvest timing across dozens of grape varietals. Manual tracking leads to suboptimal harvest decisions and lost revenue from timing mistakes.

## What We're Building

A vineyard management system that tracks blocks, grape varietals, soil sensors, and harvest predictions with automated quality scoring.

## Custom Objects

| Object | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `Vineyard_Block__c` | Individual vineyard blocks — acreage, slope, elevation, irrigation |
| `Grape_Varietal__c` | Grape types — brix targets, maturity, disease resistance, pricing |
| `Soil_Reading__c` | Sensor data — pH, moisture, nitrogen, temperature per block |
| `Harvest_Prediction__c` | AI-driven predictions — yield, quality score, harvest timing |

## LWC Wow Moment

An interactive vineyard map LWC showing real-time block health scores with color-coded tiles, hoverable sensor data, and harvest readiness indicators.

## Prerequisites

- A Salesforce dev org, SDO (Simple Demo Org), or sandbox
- Salesforce CLI (`sf`) installed and authenticated
- Cursor IDE

---

## Step 00 — Project Scaffold (run in terminal before opening Cursor)

**What this step does:** Creates a new SFDX project folder and sets your target org so Cursor and the Salesforce CLI know where to deploy. Run these commands in your terminal (not in Cursor yet).

Run these commands in your terminal to create the SFDX project and set your target org:

```bash
sf project generate --name vinesense-analytics
cd vinesense-analytics
sf org list
sf config set target-org <your-org-alias>
```

Then open the `vinesense-analytics` folder in Cursor and proceed with Step 01.

---

## Step 01 — Custom Objects

**What this prompt does:** Creates four custom objects—**Vineyard_Block__c**, **Grape_Varietal__c**, **Soil_Reading__c**, and **Harvest_Prediction__c**—with fields for block acreage/slope/elevation/irrigation, varietal brix/maturity/pricing, soil pH/moisture/nitrogen/temperature (master-detail to Block), and harvest predictions with lookups to Block and Varietal.

Open Cursor Agent and paste:

```
Create four custom Salesforce objects for VineSense Analytics vineyard management: 1) Vineyard_Block__c with fields: Block_Name__c (text), Acres__c (number), Slope_Percentage__c (number), Elevation_Feet__c (number), Irrigation_Type__c (picklist: Drip, Sprinkler, None), Last_Inspection_Date__c (date). 2) Grape_Varietal__c with fields: Varietal_Name__c (text), Optimal_Brix_Level__c (number), Days_to_Maturity__c (number), Disease_Resistance__c (picklist: High, Medium, Low), Price_Per_Ton__c (currency). 3) Soil_Reading__c with fields: Reading_Date__c (datetime), pH_Level__c (number), Moisture_Percentage__c (number), Nitrogen_PPM__c (number), Temperature_Celsius__c (number), master-detail relationship to Vineyard_Block__c. 4) Harvest_Prediction__c with fields: Predicted_Date__c (date), Estimated_Yield_Tons__c (number), Quality_Score__c (number 1-100), Brix_Current__c (number), Recommendation__c (long text), lookup relationships to both Vineyard_Block__c and Grape_Varietal__c. Include proper field descriptions and help text for winemakers.
```

## Step 02 — Sample Data

**What this prompt does:** Generates sample data: **6 vineyard blocks**, **8 grape varietals** (e.g. Cabernet, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay with brix/maturity/pricing), **20 soil readings** across blocks, and **6 harvest predictions** linking blocks to varietals with quality scores and recommendations.

```
Create realistic sample data for VineSense Analytics: 6 Vineyard_Block__c records with names like 'Hillside East Block A', 'River Valley Block C', 'Summit Block B' with varying acres (2.5-8.0), slopes (5-25%), and elevations (400-850 feet). Create 8 Grape_Varietal__c records including Cabernet Sauvignon (23 Brix, 150 days, $3200/ton), Pinot Noir (22 Brix, 135 days, $4100/ton), Chardonnay (21 Brix, 120 days, $2800/ton), Merlot, Syrah, Sauvignon Blanc, Zinfandel, and Riesling with realistic viticulture data. Create 20 Soil_Reading__c records spread across the blocks from the past 30 days with realistic pH (6.0-7.5), moisture (15-45%), nitrogen (20-80 PPM), and temperature values. Create 6 Harvest_Prediction__c records linking blocks to varietals with predicted dates in the next 2-8 weeks, quality scores 75-95, and detailed recommendations about optimal harvest timing.
```

## Step 03 — Permission Sets

**What this prompt does:** Creates the **VineSense_Admin** permission set with full CRUD, field-level security, and View All/Modify All on Vineyard_Block__c, Grape_Varietal__c, Soil_Reading__c, and Harvest_Prediction__c.

```
Create a permission set named VineSense_Admin that grants full CRUD access (Create, Read, Edit, Delete) to all four custom objects: Vineyard_Block__c, Grape_Varietal__c, Soil_Reading__c, and Harvest_Prediction__c. Include read and edit permissions for all custom fields on these objects. Add View All and Modify All object permissions for each. Include the standard permissions: View Setup and Configuration, API Enabled, and Modify All Data. Set the license to Salesforce and add a description: 'Full administrative access for VineSense vineyard management system'.
```

---

## Step 04 — Flows & Automations

**What this prompt does:** Builds the **Harvest_Readiness_Calculator** screen flow: user selects a Vineyard_Block__c and enters current brix; flow compares to Grape_Varietal__c optimal brix and creates a Harvest_Prediction__c with recommendation (Ready / Monitor / Not Ready) and a confirmation screen.

```
Create a Salesforce Screen Flow named 'Harvest_Readiness_Calculator' that helps winemakers determine if a vineyard block is ready for harvest. The flow should: 1) Start with a screen asking the user to select a Vineyard_Block__c (lookup field) and enter Current_Brix_Reading (number input). 2) Query the related Grape_Varietal__c to get Optimal_Brix_Level__c. 3) Use a Decision element to compare current vs optimal brix: if within 0.5 points, set readiness to 'Ready - Harvest Now', if within 1.5 points set to 'Monitor - Check in 3 days', otherwise 'Not Ready - Check in 7 days'. 4) Create a new Harvest_Prediction__c record with the calculated recommendation, estimated yield based on block acres, quality score (85-95 if ready, 70-84 if monitoring, below 70 if not ready), and predicted date. 5) Show a final screen displaying the recommendation with color-coded messaging and next steps for the winemaker.
```

## Step 05 — Deploy to Org

**What this prompt does:** Runs deploy, assigns **VineSense_Admin**, and verifies the org has the four custom objects so you can use the flow and LWC.

```
Deploy all VineSense Analytics metadata to your Salesforce dev org or SDO using SFDX commands. First, verify the org is active with 'sf org list' or 'sfdx force:org:display'. Then push all source with 'sf project deploy start --target-org [your-org-alias]' or 'sfdx force:source:push --forceoverwrite'. After successful deployment, assign the VineSense_Admin permission set to the default user: 'sf org assign permset --name VineSense_Admin' or 'sfdx force:user:permset:assign --permsetname VineSense_Admin'. Finally, verify deployment by listing all custom objects. Include error handling to check if each command succeeds before proceeding to the next.
```

## Step 06 — Lightning Web Component

**What this prompt does:** Builds the **vineyardHealthDashboard** LWC: color-coded block cards (green/yellow/red by health), soil readings and moisture trend chart (Chart.js), filters (All / Ready to Harvest / Needs Attention), and SLDS styling.

```
Create a Lightning Web Component called 'vineyardHealthDashboard' that displays an interactive vineyard overview. The component should: 1) Query all Vineyard_Block__c records with their related Grape_Varietal__c and latest Soil_Reading__c data using @wire with a custom Apex controller. 2) Display blocks as color-coded cards in a responsive grid layout - green for optimal health (moisture 25-40%, pH 6.5-7.0), yellow for monitoring needed, red for issues. 3) Each card shows: block name, varietal, acres, current moisture %, pH level, and a health score calculated from sensor data. 4) Add hoverable tooltips showing detailed soil readings when user hovers over a card. 5) Include a mini chart (use Chart.js) showing moisture trend over the past 7 days for each block. 6) Add filter buttons at the top to show 'All Blocks', 'Ready to Harvest', 'Needs Attention'. Style with SLDS design tokens, use smooth animations for card transitions, and make it look polished and professional for a winemaker's dashboard.
```

## Step 07 — Push to GitHub (Optional)

This step is optional. Use it only if you want to version-control your project or share it on GitHub. You can skip it and still have a complete, deployed solution after Step 06.

**What this prompt does:** Initializes Git, adds .gitignore, creates a README (VineSense Analytics - Vineyard Management System, dev org/SDO setup), and pushes to a repo such as vinesense-salesforce.

```
Initialize a Git repository for the VineSense Analytics Salesforce project and push to GitHub. Steps: 1) Run 'git init' in the project root. 2) Create a comprehensive .gitignore file for Salesforce DX that excludes: .sfdx/, .sf/, .vscode/, node_modules/, .DS_Store, *.log, .localdevserver/, and local org config files. 3) Create a README.md with project title 'VineSense Analytics - Vineyard Management System', description of the custom objects and LWC dashboard, setup instructions for dev org or SDO setup, and a screenshot placeholder. 4) Stage all files: 'git add .'. 5) Commit with message: 'Initial commit: VineSense vineyard management system with custom objects, flows, and health dashboard LWC'. 6) Create a new GitHub repository named 'vinesense-salesforce' with description 'Precision viticulture management system built on Salesforce with AI-powered harvest predictions'. 7) Add the GitHub remote and push: 'git remote add origin [repo-url]' and 'git push -u origin main'.
```
